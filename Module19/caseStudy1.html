          <p class="mainP">Angels in Sports (AIS) is difficult to navigate in its current state. The site has several broken links, functionality issues, and has a lack luster design. Redesigning the AIS website to provide more functionality, make it more visually appealing, and provide a more successful and positive experience for users is how this site redesign can provide AIS with the improvements it needs.

            <h2> Research </h2>
          <p> A proto persona was created and a user interview plan. Interviews were conducted and pain points were identified to help learn more about users who need and use services that AIS provides. Pain points and information provided from the interviews helped in creating an affinity diagram as well as helped define the user persona. 

            The insight received was that parents like our User Persona need accessible academic and financial assistance to help their children afford athletic programs and prevent their athletic pursuits from impeding their academic success. This was crucial in developing the problem statement that the challenges of being able to find the right athletic programs, afford the programs and gear necessary to be successful, and make sure students don’t fall behind academically all prevent students from low-income families from having equal opportunities in athletics.

          <h2> Definition & Ideation </h2>
          <p> A user path was determined based on our user persona and interviews, which helped realize which tasks users performed while visiting the original AIS site. Evolving from this a user testing plan was conducted with three tasks to test on the current site. The user testing feedback was organized into a prioritization matrix to identify the key insights and decide what was essential for the redesign. From the user testing, it was determined that users were able to navigate to the about page and find more information easily and that the focus of the design needed to be improving the functionality within the Scholarships and the Donations paths.

          <h2> <u>Prototyping</u> </h2>
          <p> Low fidelity wireframes were created after all user research and ideation was completed. The next step was to create a Style Tile for the new Angels in Sports website. The Style Tile expands on the early design ideas that were started with when the Mood Board was created. The Style tile was a catalyst in bringing everything together for the prototype stage. Five second testing was conducted on the initial prototypes and the feedback was taken into account to further iterate the prototypes for the mobile and desktop versions.

          <p> Along with five second user testing, a user testing plan was created.

Feedback from users following the Usability Testing Plan were taken into account for the final high fidelity prototypes.

          <h2> <u> Conclusion </u></h2>
          <p> Moving forward, the following implementations would be great to continue:Full Completion: Although we accomplished a lot of the goals we set out to do, it would be great to implement a redesign for every page on the AIS website.Make Contact with NPO: Although we did reach out to the AIS via email and tried to find a number to call, we were unsuccessful and it would have been great to get in contact to discuss and partner more with them. More Time: Having more time would allow us to implement more micro interactions and other design elements that could personalize the website and keep improving where we ended with our design as there are still elements we can improve upon. Also more time would allow for making every button, link, etc. to be fully functional which would help the goal of reaching full completion.</p>
